            <h2>The Yilan Chair Design Competition</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The Yilan Chair Design Competition came about as a vehicle to convey the
                passion and hospitality of the people of Yilan as well as the natural beauty of
                the county’s mountain forests.
                The original idea was to use innovative design in a way that connected to
                nature and daily life, while also reflecting the county government’s long
                term vision of developing Yilan into a “children’s dreamland” and “city of
                innovation.”
                The event has also been used as a focal point for the development of cultural
                and creative industry producing furniture, stationary and toys.

            <h2>Design Concept</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> The pronounciation of YUMMY sounds like duck and rice in chinese. Ducks are the statesman with great
                achievements for protecting the crops on the beautiful Yilan plain. The duck on the top can be
                removed
                for the children to play, the farmland chair below allow the adult to join the game. People at all
                ages
                can enjoy the chair when the both parts are combined, grown-ups can experience the happiness of
                childhood, which makes the ordinary days become more fun. The aim of the design is to extend the
                life
                cycle of the product and make it an all ages available one.
